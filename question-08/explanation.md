This task demonstrates the use of Git branching and merging.



1. Created a new file and committed it to a new branch (`feature-branch`).
2. Pushed the new branch to GitHub.
3. Created a Pull Request (PR) from `feature-branch` to `master`.
4. Merged the PR on GitHub.

- **Fast-forward merge**: Happens when no diverging history exists between branches.
- **3-way merge**: Git performs a merge commit when branches diverge.

Pull Requests are essential for code review and collaborative development.
